    # This RewriteRule is used to dynamically discover the RewriteBase path.
    # See https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule
    # Here we will compare the stripped per-dir path *relative to the filesystem
    # path where the .htaccess file is read from* with the URI of the request.
    #
    # If a match is found, the prefix path is stored into an ENV var that is later
    # used to properly prefix the URI of the front controller index.php.
    # This is what makes it possible to host a Symfony application under a subpath,
    # such as example.com/subpath

    # The convoluted rewrite condition means:
    #   1. Match all current URI in the RewriteRule and backreference it using $0
    #   2. Strip the request uri the per-dir path and use ir as REQUEST_URI.
    #      This is documented in https://bit.ly/3zDm3SI ("What is matched?")
    #   3. Evaluate the RewriteCond, assuming your DocumentRoot is /var/www/html,
    #      this .htaccess is in the /var/www/html/public dir and your request URI
    #      is /public/hello/world:
    #      * strip per-dir prefix: /var/www/html/public/hello/world -> hello/world
    #      * applying pattern '.*' to uri 'hello/world'
    #      * RewriteCond: input='/public/hello/world::hello/world' pattern='^(/.+)/(.*)::\\2$' => matched
    #   4. Execute the RewriteRule:
    #      * The %1 in the RewriteRule flag E=BASE:%1 refers to the first group captured in the RewriteCond ^(/.+)/(.*)
    #      * setting env variable 'BASE' to '/public'
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$0 ^(/.+)/(.*)::\2$
    RewriteRule .* - [E=BASE:%1]
